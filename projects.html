        <p>My name is Shenica Renee Graham. You are viewing my portfolio archive including all of my design works. For web design projects specifically, view my website portfolio. I am an avid online content creator, recording artist, web and CSS designer, author, teacher, tutor, and creative thinker. If you are looking for someone with ideas, you have come to the right place. I have experience creating online programs, marketing solutions, branding, graphic designs, websites, publications, blogs, apparel, accessories, author and artist promotions, music, and so much more! Hire me for your next design project.</p>
        <p>I have over 20 years of experience in online writing, authoring hundreds documents including of blogs, articles, books, and reviews. I have over 10 years of experience teaching Bible study. I also host a psychology university online. By private study, I am a Web and CSS artist. As a Webmaster and WordPress enthusiast since 2007, I have authored over 56 websites showcasing my graphic designs and prolific writing.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for education and teaching is my first academic love. I hold a BA in Psychology and BA in General Studies, both from Wichita State University. I am currently a Full Stack Web Design student. I teach biblical and psychology courses, specializing in spiritual development and mental health disorders, especially schizoaffective bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and major depression – all of which I battle daily. Teaching online has provided me the opportunity to give back to my community in a tangible way.</p>
        <p>I inherited my father’s poignant writing style and manuscript treasure. I am currently co-writing with my father (posthumously), “Walking The Talk: The Road to Manhood and Womanhood,” which combines two books he originally published separately.</p>
        <p>I began having symptoms of mental illness as a teenager and so I understand many of the issues that complicate challenges facing youth and adults including suicidal ideology. This is why I have a deep desire to serve the mental health community, offering courses that help students develop practical coping skills to rise from their battles with mental illness. I currently live mental health from both perspectives of patient and life coach. My goal is to empower those living with mental illness and to educate those working with us.</p>
        <p>My courses teach practical life skills that can modify behavior and help avoid debilitating symptoms of mental illness. If mental health sparks your interest, I look forward to welcoming you to classes that will make the mind work for you.</p>
        <p>You can learn more about me by watching my favorite movies. Take a look at my review of Tyler Perry's Good Deeds.</p>
